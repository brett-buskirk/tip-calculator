# Tip Calculator Program #

This is a Python command line program that calculates a total bill cost, including the cost per person, based on user input. The program has a static sales tax set at 10%, but prompts the user for the cost of the meal, the number of people splitting the bill, and the desired tip percentage.

## Expected Inputs ##

The expected inputs are as follows:

  * bill cost (positive float)
  * number of people splitting the bill (positive integer)
  * tip percentage (positive float, or zero)

If the input doesn't match one of the above values, the prompt will repeat until the correct value type is given. Once all the correct inputs are given, the results will be calculated and returned as a block in the terminal.

## How to Use the Script ##

To use this program, simply navigate your terminal to the file's directory and enter the following command:

```bash
  python tip_calculator.py
```

Depending on your system's configuration, you may have to use:

```bash

Once the script runs, simply follow the prompts until your answer is calculated.
